## Overview

This is a simple web scraping program using BeautifulSoup4.

## Requirements

I used Python 2.7.10 with BeautifulSoup4.

## Usage

Run python webscrape.py.

## Known Issues

The program choked on the team San Jos&eacute; State, therefore I used a small subset of teams that did not include San Jos&eacute; State to test my program. I'll need to take a look at that.
